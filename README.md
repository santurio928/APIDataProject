# introduction

The overall project consisted of creating a website for visualize different insights of the grants in spain.


After we did a crawler for the national website of grants("https://www.pap.hacienda.gob.es/bdnstrans/GE/es/convocatoria") we obtained adataset, but we had to process it and gave it to our team mates of frontend. The best way to do that was through an API.


# Creating An API
 Following the Instructions.md you can create an API on python

# Creating the code

Following dataTeamAPI.py you can make a functional API for a purpose 

# Testing API 

You can use several programs like Insomnia for testing the API, I will add some screenshots of how to do a query to our API
